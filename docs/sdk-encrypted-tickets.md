# Authorizing GOG GALAXY Users in Third-Party Services

The GOG GALAXY SDK provides access to Encrypted App Tickets, which can be used by a game for seamless GOG user authorization in any third-party backend.

Encrypted App Tickets are created and encrypted in the GOG GALAXY backend using a shared Private Key. The game can request the ticket for the current user, and the ticket can be passed to any third-party backend that also knows the Private Key and will be able to decrypt the data and thus confirm the userâ€™s identity and their license for the game. The whole process is shown on the following picture:

## Retrieving the Encrypted App Ticket

1. Request the ticket using the [`IUser::RequestEncryptedAppTicket()`](https://docs.gog.com/galaxyapi/classgalaxy_1_1api_1_1IUser.html#a29f307e31066fc39b93802e363ea2064) method of the GOG GALAXY SDK and provide any additional elements in its `data` parameter. By default, the following data is enclosed in the ticket:
    - `user_id`

    - `client_id`

    - timestamp of ticket generation.

2. The response to this call comes to [`IEncryptedAppTicketListener`](https://docs.gog.com/galaxyapi/classgalaxy_1_1api_1_1IEncryptedAppTicketListener.html).
3. If the request was successful ([`OnEncryptedAppTicketRetrieveSuccess()`](https://docs.gog.com/galaxyapi/classgalaxy_1_1api_1_1IEncryptedAppTicketListener.html#ae5ad1ca3940e9df9ebc21e25799aa084)), you can retrieve the ticket with the [`IUser::GetEncryptedAppTicket() `](https://docs.gog.com/galaxyapi/classgalaxy_1_1api_1_1IUser.html#a96af6792efc260e75daebedca2cf74c6) method.

## Using the Ticket in a Third-Party Backend

App Tickets are encrypted using [AES (Rijndael)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Encryption_Standard) with a 128-bit block size, 256-bit encryption key in the CBC mode.

In order to use the ticket, first you will need to transfer `encrypted_ticket.private_key` for your game to your backend service:

1. Go to the [GOG Developer Portal](https://devportal.gog.com).

2. Click *Games* in the main menu.

3. In the resulting list of your games, click the *SDK Credentials* button for your desired game:

    ![SDK Credentials](_assets/games-sdk-credentials.png)

4. A pop-up window appears with the SDK Credentials. Copy the value of the third entry (`encrypted_ticket.private_key`):

    ![Encrypted Ticket Private Key](_assets/sdk-encrypted-ticket-key.png)

5. Use this value for the `CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY` variable in either of the scripts.

The following scripts are sample implementations of decoding EncryptedAppTickets in a third-party backend.

=== "PHP"

    In our [GitHub repository](https://github.com/gogcom/galaxy-session-tickets-php) you will find a simple PHP library which decodes encrypted tickets. The script below makes use of this library in a PHP-based backend.
    
    ``` php
    <?php
    
    require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
    
    $mcryptPlaintext = \GOG\SessionTickets\MCryptSessionTicketDecoder::decode(
        \GOG\SessionTickets\ExampleData::ENCRYPTED_SESSION_TICKET,
        \GOG\SessionTickets\ExampleData::CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY
    );
    
    $openSSLplaintext = \GOG\SessionTickets\OpenSSLSessionTicketDecoder::decode(
        \GOG\SessionTickets\ExampleData::ENCRYPTED_SESSION_TICKET,
        \GOG\SessionTickets\ExampleData::CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY
    );
    
    if ($openSSLplaintext === $mcryptPlaintext && $mcryptPlaintext === \GOG\SessionTickets\ExampleData::PLAINTEXT_SESSION_TICKET) {
        echo $openSSLplaintext."\n";
    } else {
        throw new \Exception('Encrypted Session Ticket decryption failed');
    }
    ```

=== "Python"

    ``` python
    from Crypto.Cipher import AES
    import base64
    
    ENCRYPTED_SESSION_TICKET = "galaxy::api::User()->GetEncryptedAppTicket()"
    CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY =   # enter encrypted_ticket.private_key here
    
    encrypted_ticket = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(ENCRYPTED_SESSION_TICKET)  # both app ticket and private key
    clientPrivateKey = base64.urlsafe_b64decode(CLIENT_PRIVATE_KEY)        # are UrlSafe Base64 encoded, so there's no need to encode them again
    
    IV = encrypted_ticket[:16]  # IV is the first 16 bytes of the ticket
    cipher = AES.new(clientPrivateKey, AES.MODE_CBC, IV)
    
    encrypted_data = encrypted_ticket[16:]  # encrypted_data is the rest of the encrypted_ticket
    print(cipher.decrypt(encrypted_data))
    ```
