# Offline Installers

Offline (backup) installers are automatically generated on our servers after you publish a build to the Master branch. Because these installers are queued up for generation and publishing, there may be a delay of several hours between a build being published on the Master branch and an offline installer appearing in the game library.

!!! Important
    **Please note that this is only applicable to builds updated post-launch**. For the Day-1 launch, we will trigger the generation of offline installers right after receiving a Release Candidate for QA tests; this will ensure the offline installers go live at the same time the Release Candidate is published to the Master branch.
