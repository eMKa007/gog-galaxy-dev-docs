# Installation Directory

## Windows and Linux

![Installation Directory Windows/Linux](_assets/bc-installation-dir-win.png)

Define the name of the folder, in which the game will be installed in. It defaults to the game name, but you can change it to any valid folder name.

## macOS

![Installation Directory macOS](_assets/bc-installation-dir-mac.png)

For macOS projects, we recommend installing your game as an app bundle. By default, Build Creator will generate a path with the *.app* extension.

If you want to install as a folder with the game files inside, please use the *Normal folder* option, and if you want to change the name of the installation directory, select *Custom*.
