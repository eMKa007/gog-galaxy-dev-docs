If you already have a JSON file for your project, you can import it to GOG GALAXY Build Creator:

1. Specify the *Import Path* to the existing project JSON file.
2. Set the *Project Name* to anything you want. The project name will not be displayed to end-users and is here for your convenience only.
3. Once you are ready, click *Import* button. New project will be created based on the imported JSON file, and you will be taken to the project screen.
