# Quick Start

This tutorial will guide you through the simplest path to successfully deliver your game to our users with GOG Build Creator. We will be using a sample product: it will support only one language and will be provided with just a 32â€“bit executable, resulting in a single package. Moreover, it will contain only one **Depot** and one **Task**.

We encourage you to go through the whole process, so you get familiarized with the basic concepts. If you want to learn more, each article will provide links to more advanced topics.

!!! Important
    Before you start, just make sure you have all the prerequisites mentioned in [*Getting Started*](quick-start.md) along with a license for the game (and all its DLCs) that you want to upload.
